# T9 Decoder

- **Two functions** can be performed using this decoder. The first function is the *conversion of text to t9 code*, and the second is the *conversion of t9 code to text*.

## Text to T9 Code

- The conversion of *text into t9 code* is done by using the entered text to obtain numbers arranged according to the **t9 keyboard**.

### Example

hello = **44 33 555 555 666** / text = t9

- Text: hello
- T9 Code: 44 33 555 555 666

## T9 Code to Text

- In reverse conversion, ie in the *conversion of t9 code into text* based on the entered code, the numbers in the **t9 keyboard** are compared together with their positions. This is how *text* is generated.

### Example

222 666 3 33 0 3 33 222 666 3 33 77 = **code decoder** / t9 = text

- T9 Code: 222 666 3 33 0 3 33 222 666 3 33 77
- Text: code decoder

## T9 Keyboard

- The **T9 keyboard** in this code consists of an array containing arrays, these arrays in order and position are identical to those on the *classic t9 keyboard*. Later, this main array is used to compare the positions of arrays, but also their elements in order to generate *code* or *text*.
